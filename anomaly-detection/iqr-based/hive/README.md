# Anomaly Detection 

Outlier detection has been used for centuries to detect and, where appropriate, remove anomalous observations from data. Outliers arise due to mechanical
faults, changes in system behaviour, fraudulent behaviour, human error, instrument
error or simply through natural deviations in populations. Their detection can
identify system faults and fraud before they escalate with potentially catastrophic
consequences. It can identify errors and remove their contaminating effect on the
data set and as such to purify the data for processing. The original outlier detection
methods were arbitrary but now, principled and systematic techniques are used,
drawn from the full gamut of Computer Science and Statistics

**What is an Interquartile Range?**

The interquartile range is a measure of where the bulk of the dataset values are is in a data set.

The IQR is defined as the difference between the 75% (Q3) percentile and the 25%(Q1) percentile of your dataset


**Use Case:**
